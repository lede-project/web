Development
===========

== The Source Code

The LEDE project source code starts off with OpenWrt revision r49258. The code
is stored inside a git tree which contains all branches and releases ever made
by OpenWrt. While importing the sources the tree was normalised and some
minor tweaks were made to committer names and mail addresses.

All repositories can be browsed online through
https://git.lede-project.org/[Gitweb] as well.

=== Getting The _LEDE_ Code

Any _LEDE_ development happens in the main +source.git+ repository which is
accessible via both HTTP and HTTPS:

----
git clone https://git.lede-project.org/source.git
----

You can find a mirror of the repository on Github:

----
git clone https://github.com/lede-project/source.git
----

=== Getting the OpenWrt Code

We keep the original OpenWrt source code up to
https://git.lede-project.org/?p=openwrt/source.git;a=commit;h=ee53a240ac902dc83209008a2671e7fdcf55957a[r49258]
available, mostly as reference and for historic interest.

The original OpenWrt Subversion repository has been split up into several Git
repositories mapping the various SVN directories and tags to proper Git
branches.

----
git clone https://git.lede-project.org/openwrt/source.git
git clone https://git.lede-project.org/openwrt/packages.git
git clone https://git.lede-project.org/openwrt/feeds.git
git clone https://git.lede-project.org/openwrt/docs.git
----

=== The Web Presence

The pages you're reading are generated from text files using the
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] suite. Any changes made to the
projects web site will be reflected in our +web.git+ repository:

----
git clone https://git.lede-project.org/web.git
----

=== Submitting Patches

The biggest difference is that we now accept pull requests. Patches can be submitted as either a pull request on Github or small fixes and minor patches can also be submitted via the mailing list. Submissions should follow these rules:

. A `Signed-off-by` line must be added to your commit / patch in accordance with Section 1.1 of the https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches[Linux Kernel patches guide].
.. Git: `git commit --signoff`
.. Email: Just add line like `Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>` to the top patch.
. TBD

==== Github

There are Github mirrors of the https://github.com/lede-project/source[source] and https://github.com/lede-project/web[web] repos. Simply fork the project to a public repo using Github web interface, clone the repo to your computer, create a branch for your changes, push these back to Github and submit a pull request.

For example, to submit a pull request for these web-pages, follow these instructions and then submit PR using Github web interface:
----
git clone git@github.com:<github username>/web.git
git checkout -b <branch-name>
<make changes to files>
git commit --signoff
git push --all
----

==== Email

Send an email to the https://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/lede-dev[development mailing list]. All patches need to be sent in the same format as those that are listed on https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/lede/list/[patchwork]. If the patch does not get listed in patchwork then it won't get processed. For example, to print a patch for the most recent commit, `git format-patch -1 --stdout`. Double check that your output conforms before sending.

=== Staging Trees

To create yourself a staging tree on git.lede-project.org:
----
ssh git@git.lede-project.org "create lede/yournick/staging"
ssh git@git.lede-project.org "desc lede/yournick/staging Staging tree of Your Name"
----


=== Reporting Bugs

. Please report your bugs using our https://bugs.lede-project.org/[issue tracker]
. When reporting bugs please make sure to
  .. Name the tree/revision
  .. Name the affected device
  .. What does it do that it should not do / what does it not do that it should do
  .. Steps to reproduce
  .. What you have already done to fix the problem
  .. Any additional info you thinks is important
. Reporting a bug means that you reported a bug. It does not constitute a claim that
  anyone has to work on fixing it.
. Pointless/vague/silly/... bugs reports will be ignored
. The better your bug report, the more likely it is that it will be worked on.


=== Patch Merging And Tree Life Cycle

We encourage committers to host their own staging trees where they aggregate patches
that they feel responsible for and/or ones that they created themselves. Once the tree
has been reviewed and tested it can be proposed for inclusion in the master branch.

. Trees will be merged into master at any time
. Bug fixes can be merged into master directly
. PRs can be sent to the patches mailing list from any source and will always be considered
  for inclusion if the quality of the tree is good and format of submission is correct
. Staging trees can be hosted as part of the projects git infrastucture, private servers, ...

=== Kernel updates

It has proven impractical and a time killer to always be on the very latest kernel within
2 days of its release. It has caused these issues.

. diversification of kernel versions
. pressure on maintainers to constantly upgrade rather than stabilise
. huge effort invested to upgrade 3-4 times between releases
. huge workload to maintain kmod-* packaging
. Upgrade to kernels that might not be fully tested

This is obviously not an invite to sit on ancient and dusty kernels. A sane path in between
should be taken that give the community recent kernels without causing unnecessary workload
and stability issues.

There should be a max of three concurrent kernel version. Having only two concurrent versions
is better than three.

In Short - stability should be valued higher than bleeding edge, although bleeding edge is
also important, but not as a trade-off to stability.


=== Releases

Generating Releases has already been vastly automated. The remaining parts of the process need
to also be automated before the first _LEDE_ release. We will introduce a TESTERS file that is
formatted similarly to the MAINTAINERS file of the kernel. Community members can list themselves
as testers for a target/profile/device. Once a release has been generated testers should receive
an email informing them of the requirement for images to be tested. It needs to be decided if only
tested images should be included in the binary release.

Releases should

. Happen at least once a year
. Have at least one maintenance update
. Provide CVE/critical/... fixes for at least one year after the release
. Only include maintained targets
. Only include targets that have seen on device testing
. Be ready when they are ready

See the TODO page for more info.
