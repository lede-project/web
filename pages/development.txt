LEDE Development
================

== The Source Code

The LEDE project source code start off with OpenWrt revision r49083. The code
is stored inside a git tree which contains all branches and releases ever made
by OpenWrt. While importing the sources the tree was normalised and some
minor tweaks were made to comitter names and mail addresses.

All repositories can be browsed online through
http://git.lede-project.org/[Gitweb] as well.

=== Getting The _LEDE_ Code

Any _LEDE_ development happens in the main +source.git+ repository which is
accessible via both HTTP and HTTPS:

----
git clone http://git.lede-project.org/source.git
----

=== Getting the OpenWrt Code

We keep the original OpenWrt source code up to r49083 available, mostly as
reference and for historic interest.

The original OpenWrt Subversion repository has been split up into several Git
repositories mapping the various SVN directories and tags to proper Git
branches.

----
git clone http://git.lede-project.org/openwrt/source.git
git clone http://git.lede-project.org/openwrt/packages.git
git clone http://git.lede-project.org/openwrt/feeds.git
git clone http://git.lede-project.org/openwrt/docs.git
----

=== The Web Presence

The pages you're reading are generated from text files using the
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] suite. Any changes made to the
projects web site will be reflected in our +web.git+ repository:

----
git clone http://git.lede-project.org/web.git
----

=== Submitting Patches

The biggest difference is that we now accept pull requests. The tree that shall
be pulled from needs to be hosted publicly. Small fixes and minor patches can
also be submitted via the mailing list (__LINK__). Submissions should follow
these rules

. rule N+1

All patches need to be sent in a format that they are listed in patchwork (__LINK__).
If the patch does not get listed in patchwork then it wont get processed.


=== Reporting Bugs

. *All* bug reports need to be submitted via the mailing list (__LINK__)
. When reporting bugs please make sure to
  .. Name the tree/revision
  .. Name the effected device
  .. What does it do that it should not do / what does it not do that it should do
  .. Steps to reproduce
  .. What you have already done to fix the problem
  .. Any additional info you thinks is important
. Reporting a bug means that you reported a bug. It does not constitute a claim that
  anyone has to work on fixing it.
. Pointless/vague/silly/... bugs reports will be ignored
. Feature requests are not Bugs. They will also be ignored.
. The better your bug report, the more likely it is that it will be worked on.

All bug reports need to be sent in a format so that they are listed in the issue
tracker (__LINK__). If the bug report does not get listed in the issue tracker then
it wont get processed.


=== Patch Merging And Tree Life Cycle

We encourage committers to host their own staging trees where they aggregate patches
that they feel responsible for and/or ones that they created themselves. Once the tree
has been reviewed and tested it can be proposed for inclusion in the master branch.

. Trees will be merged into master during a merge window
. The date when the next merge window opens will be announced in advance
. The window should be less than a week
. Only bug fixes can be merged outside the merge window via the fixes branch (__LINK__)
. No new features/update/... may be merged outside the window
. PRs can be sent to the patches mailing list from any source and will always be considered
  for inclusion if the quality of the tree is good and format of submission is correct


=== Kernel updates

It has proven impractical and a time killer to always be on the very latest kernel within
2 days of its release. It has caused these issues.

. diversification of kernel versions
. pressure on maintainers to constantly upgrade rather than stabilise
. huge effort invested to upgrade 3-4 times between releases
. huge workload to maintain kmod-* packaging
. Upgrade to kernels that might not be fully tested

This is obviously not an invite to sit on ancient and dusty kernels. A sane path in between
should be taken that give the community recent kernels without causing unnecessary workload
and stability issues.

There should be a max of three concurrent kernel version. Having only two concurrent versions
is better than three.

In Short - stability should be valued higher than bleeding edge, although bleeding edge is
also important, but not as a trade-off to stability.


=== Releases

Generating Releases has already been vastly automated. The remaining parts of the process need
to also be automated before the first _LEDE_ release. We will introduce a TESTERS file that is
formatted similarly to the MAINTAINERS file of the kernel. Community members can list themselves
as testers for a target/profile/device. Once a release has been generated testers should receive
an email informing them of the requirement for images to be tested. It needs to be decided if only
tested images should be included in the binary release.

Releases should

. Happen at least once a year
. Have at least one maintenance update
. Provide CVE/critical/... fixes for at least one year after the release
. Only include maintained targets
. Only include targets that have seen on device testing
. Be ready when they are ready

See the TODO page for more info.
